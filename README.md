# Crimson Desert Ultimate Mods Manager (BETA)

A desktop mod manager for **Crimson Desert** that understands the game's PAZ/PAMT/PAPGT archive format. Install, manage, and safely combine multiple mods with automatic conflict detection and one-click revert to vanilla.

## Features

### Drag-and-Drop Import
Drop a mod onto the window and it's installed. Supports multiple formats:

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `.zip` | Archives containing modified game files or installer scripts |
| Folders | Loose directories with modified PAZ/PAMT files |
| `.bat` / `.py` | Script-based installers — runs in a visible console, captures changes automatically |
| `.bsdiff` | Pre-generated binary patches |
| `.asi` | Native ASI plugins (installed to `bin64/`) |

### Delta-Based Patching
Mods are stored as binary deltas against vanilla game files, not full file copies. This means:

- **Small on disk** — only the changed bytes are saved
- **Composable** — multiple mods can modify the same PAZ file at different offsets
- **Reversible** — vanilla files are always preserved and restorable

The engine automatically selects between sparse patches (for small, scattered changes) and bsdiff4 (for larger modifications).

### 3-Level Conflict Detection

When two mods touch the same files, the manager detects the conflict and shows exactly what overlaps:

| Level | What It Means | Action |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **PAPGT** (metadata) | Mods modify PAMT in different directories | Auto-handled, no action needed |
| **PAZ** (archive) | Same PAZ file, different byte ranges | Usually compatible — shown as info |
| **Byte-Range** (data) | Overlapping byte ranges in the same file | Resolved by load order — winner shown in UI |

Conflicts are displayed in a tree view at the bottom of the window with color-coded severity and explanations of what each mod changes.

### Load Order & Priority
- Drag mods up and down to set priority
- Higher position = applied last = wins conflicts
- Enable/disable individual mods without removing them

### One-Click Apply & Revert
- **Apply** composes all enabled mods onto vanilla files using atomic file operations (never leaves the game in a half-patched state)
- **Revert to Vanilla** restores original game files instantly
- Crash recovery via `.pre-apply` markers if something goes wrong mid-apply

### Script Mod Support
For mods distributed as installer scripts (`.bat` or `.py`):

1. Drop the zip/script onto the manager
2. A console window opens — interact with the installer normally
3. The manager automatically detects which game files changed and captures them as deltas
4. The mod is now managed like any other — can be disabled, reordered, or reverted

The manager passes `CDMM_GAME_DIR` as an environment variable so scripts can find the game directory automatically.

### ASI Plugin Management
A dedicated **ASI Plugins** tab for managing native DLL plugins:

- Scans `bin64/` for installed `.asi` files
- Enable/disable plugins (renames to `.asi.disabled`)
- Detects hook conflicts between plugins
- Opens `.ini` config files in your text editor
- Shows ASI Loader status

### Test Mod (Dry Run)
Check if a mod is compatible with your current setup **before** installing:

- Analyzes which files the mod changes
- Runs conflict detection against all installed mods
- Generates a compatibility report (exportable as Markdown)

### Vanilla Snapshot
On first launch, the manager takes a SHA-256 snapshot of all game files. This snapshot is used for:

- Detecting changes made by script mods
- Generating accurate deltas
- Verifying game file integrity

### Bug Report
Built-in diagnostic report generator that collects:

- System info (OS, Python version, memory)
- Installed mods and their conflict status
- Database state and snapshot status
- Recent log entries

Copy to clipboard or save as a file for troubleshooting.

## Installation

### Option 1: Standalone Executable
Download `CrimsonDesertModManager.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/faisalkindi/CrimsonDesert-UltimateModsManager/releases) page. No Python required.

### Option 2: Run from Source
Requires Python 3.10+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/faisalkindi/CrimsonDesert-UltimateModsManager.git
cd CrimsonDesert-UltimateModsManager
pip install -e .
python src/cdmm/main.py
```

### Building the Executable

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
python scripts/build.py
```

The exe is written to `dist/CrimsonDesertModManager.exe`.

## How It Works

Crimson Desert stores game data in PAZ archives, indexed by PAMT files, with PAPGT as a hash registry. This manager:

1. **Snapshots** vanilla game files on first run
2. **Imports** mods by diffing modified files against vanilla, storing only the binary delta
3. **Composes** all enabled mod deltas onto vanilla in priority order when you click Apply
4. **Rebuilds** the PAPGT integrity chain so the game accepts the modified files
5. **Commits** atomically — all files are staged and swapped in one operation

All data is stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\cdmm\`:
- `cdmm.db` — mod registry, snapshots, conflicts
- `vanilla/` — backup of original game files
- `deltas/` — binary patches for each mod

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Crimson Desert (Steam)
- ~1 GB free disk space for vanilla backups
